PowerTOP tries to show which software components in your system consume power by using the various fragments of information Linux exposes in /proc and /sys, with the goal of allowing users to see and fix the top consumers of power.

Powertop has moved to GIT. Please checkout our git tree from git.moblin.org instead of using SVN.
